Configuration
Email Configuration: Update the sender_email and password (or sendgrid_api_key) variables with your email credentials.

Troubleshooting
If using Gmail, ensure "Less secure app access" is enabled in your Google account settings.
If using Gmail with 2FA, generate an app-specific password and use it in place of your regular password.
If using SendGrid, ensure your API key is valid and has the necessary permissions.
